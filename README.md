# PyBank and PyPoll Projects


## PyBank Summary (first challenge)

In this project, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a fictitious company. I was given a set of financial data stored in [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/jaryan77/PyBank-and-PyPoll-Project/blob/main/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

The Python script is to include the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

#
## PyPoll Summary (second challenge)

* In this project, I was tasked with helping a fictitious, rural town in modernizing its vote counting process

* I was given a set of polling data called [election_data.csv](https://github.com/jaryan77/PyBank-and-PyPoll-Project/blob/main/PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. My task was to create a Python script that analyzes and calculates each of the following:
    
    * The total number of votes cast

    * A complete list of candidates who received votes

    * The percentage of votes each candidate won

    * The total number of votes each candidate won

    * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

# 
## Running the Code

* To run this code you must complete the following steps: 

    * First, clone the repository to your local machine.

    * Next, navigate to either the `PyBank` or `PyPoll` directory in your command line

    * Since both challenges run off a file named `main.py`, it's just a matter of running simple command `$ python main.py`
